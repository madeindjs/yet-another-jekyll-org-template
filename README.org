* Using Jekyll to publish Org mode texts

This repository documents how to setup a Jekyll site that is able to
export Org mode files, as well as the flow that I use for publishing them.

** Setup

Install =Jekyll= and also (optionally) =re-org= for creating 
new Org files based on templates.

#+begin_src sh :tangle setup.sh
gem install jekyll
gem install re-org
#+end_src

Now fetch the =OrgJekyll= submodule that would enable us stop using
the YAML front matter and instead rely on Org mode syntax:

#+begin_src sh :tangle setup.sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
#+end_src

** Creating a new writing

#+begin_src sh
re-org new jekyll-post --title=hello-world
#+end_src

Would create this file in ~_drafts/2013-12-09-hello-world.org~:

#+begin_src org
  ,#+title:         Hello world
  ,#+date:          2013-12-09
  ,#+layout:        post
  ,#+category:      posts
  
  ,Your content would go here!
  
#+end_src

Once you are done writing, publish and render it with =jekyll server
--drafts=. Or in case your writing is already done:

#+begin_src sh
mv _drafts/2013-12-09-hello-world.org _posts/
jekyll server
#+end_src

Then just publish the generated HTML in =_site= on the hosting of your preference.

Hope this helps!
